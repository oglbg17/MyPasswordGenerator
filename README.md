# MyPasswordGenerator
I added varriables to the top of the java file so we have all the arrias in order. 
The code already had the generate class that it pulled from
Added the getPrompts to the function in line 17 so it can call getPrompts
Coded every line of if statments so it can generate the password the user wants
